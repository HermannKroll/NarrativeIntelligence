1352300|t|Selective inhibition of protein targeting to the apical domain of MDCK cells by brefeldin A 
1352300|a|Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) is mainly vectorially targeted to the apical surface in MDCK cells. BFA was found to abolish the apical targeting of DPPIV. This BFA effect could be achieved under conditions where the ER to Golgi transport and the total surface expression of DPPIV were essentially unaffected. BFA executed its effect during the transport from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the surface. The inhibition of apical targeting resulted in enhanced mis-targeting to the basolateral surface. The mistargeted DPPIV was transcytosed back to the apical domain only after BFA withdrawal. In contrast, the basolateral targeting of uvomorulin was unaffected by BFA. These results established that the apical targeting of DPPIV was selectively abolished by BFA.
