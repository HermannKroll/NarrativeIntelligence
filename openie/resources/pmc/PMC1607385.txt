1607385|t|Release of myosin II from the membrane-cytoskeleton of Dictyostelium discoideum mediated by heavy-chain phosphorylation at the foci within the cortical actin network 
1607385|a|Membrane-cytoskeletons were prepared from Dictyostelium amebas, and networks of actin and myosin II filaments were visualized on the exposed cytoplasmic surfaces of the cell membranes by fluorescence staining (Yumura, S., and T. Kitanishi-Yumura. 1990. Cell Struct. Funct. 15:355-364). Addition of ATP caused contraction of the cytoskeleton with aggregation of part of actin into several foci within the network, but most of myosin II was released via the foci. However, in the presence of 10 mM MgCl2, which stabilized myosin II filaments, myosin II remained at the foci. Ultrastructural examination revealed that, after contraction, only traces of monomeric myosin II remained at the foci. By contrast, myosin II filaments remained in the foci in the presence of 10 mM MgCl2. These observations suggest that myosin II was released not in a filamentous form but in a monomeric form. Using [gamma 32P]ATP, we found that the heavy chains of myosin II released from membrane-cytoskeletons were phosphorylated, and this phosphorylation resulted in disassembly of myosin filaments. Using ITP (a substrate for myosin II ATPase) and/or ATP gamma S (a substrate for myosin II heavy-chain kinase [MHCK]), we demonstrated that phosphorylation of myosin heavy chains occurred at the foci within the actin network, a result that suggests that MHCK was localized at the foci. These results together indicate that, during contraction, the heavy chains of myosin II that have moved toward the foci within the actin network are phosphorylated by a specific MHCK, with the resultant disassembly of filaments which are finally released from membrane- cytoskeletons. This series of reactions could represent the mechanism for the relocation of myosin II from the cortical region to the endoplasm.
