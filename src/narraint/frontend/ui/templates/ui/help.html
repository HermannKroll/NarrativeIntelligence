        The service contains about 35 million publication abstracts from PubMed. In brief, everything that can be found by a PubMed search can also be found in our system.
        In addition, we included about 50k COVID 19 pre-prints from the <a href="https://preview.zbmed.de">ZB MED Preview Service</a>.
