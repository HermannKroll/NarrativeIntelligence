"""
This is the test package for our Project.

Structure:
    - src contains all the test suits mirroring the structure of the project. Should be used as test root
    - resources contains all test files for the tests
    - config contains global configuration for all tests as well as config files for single tests
    - util contains test helper code that can be utitlized by all tests
    - tmp a tempdir for all statically configured paths. cleared before session start

Testing:
    - it is recommended to use pytest, but unittest should work as well
    - use src as root for tests

Creating new tests:
    1. if not already existing, create a mirror directory of the module you want to test
    2. Create a file called test_<to_be_tested>.py
    3. Create a class Test<ToBeTested> (unittest.TestCase)
    4. create methods def test_<to_be_tested>(self)

Notes:
    - Make sure that no import statements throw exceptions or gobble up to much runtime! The collection step might fail
      then.
