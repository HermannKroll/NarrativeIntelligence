3|t| A Phase II Trial of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy With Nanoparticle Albumin-bound Paclitaxel and Fluorouracil Followed by Surgery in Patients With Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Esophagus
3|a| In the past decade, clinical trials have evaluated the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiation, or both, for patients with surgically resectable esophageal carcinoma, but have all failed to demonstrate a consistent survival benefit. In Eastern countries, preoperative chemotherapy followed by radical surgery became one of the treatment strategies for resectable, clinical stage II or III esophageal cancer. In an effort to improve the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy, we conducted a prospective study to evaluate the regimen of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel plus 5-fluorouracil as perioperative therapy for patients with resectable esophageal carcinoma.
